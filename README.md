# Browser Handoff Wrapper
Browser Handoff Wrapper is an application created to add handoff support for third party browsers.

I am using Google Chrome as my primary web browser on my Mac, but it doesn't support the new handoff feature. When I open a web page in Safari on my iPhone, a Google Chrome icon appears in the dock, but nothing happens when I click on that icon. So I created this wrapper to redirect the request to the browser.

# How to use

 1. Install BrowserHandoffWrapper to your Applications directory
 2. Run the application
 3. Click on *Install Handler*
 4. Choose the browser you wish to use as default browser
 5. Done. You can open Safari in your iPhone and an icon will appear in your dock.
